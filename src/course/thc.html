              <p class="CourseLanding-breakdown-text">
                This first week, Dr. Phillips covers basic questions such as: How to identify the calling? Am I called
                to one of the five-fold offices? To what type of ministry is God calling me?

              <p class="CourseLanding-breakdown-text">
                In week two, the teaching will center around next steps such as where to start. Biblical examples of
                people who were called by God: Jeremiah, Paul, James & John, and the Elect Lady. How do I differentiate
                a passion from a calling? What does the heart of the servant look like?

              <p class="CourseLanding-breakdown-text">
                Week three moves into personal preparation. Is schooling necessary or will a mentor suffice? When I
                think about discipline, what is important to focus on? How am I exhibiting my faith and is it practical,
                will it impact others? What am I doing to develop my own faith day by day?

              <p class="CourseLanding-breakdown-text">
                This week brings the subjects of remaining accountable and responsibility to the forefront. To whom am I
                accountable - God, family, church, or the calling? What responsibility has been laid on my shoulders
                with the calling? What about authority?

                After all this, what good are Credentials and Titles? The world has changed so much that many people
                don't seem to give a second thought to titles and credentials. Why should I consider them? Are they
                important in the realm of the Kingdom?

                How can I prepare for stepping into a new role using the gifts of the Spirit? How do the gifts of the
